- Paragraphs are styled correctly.
Left, Center, Right, Justify aligned paragraphs align properly.
- h1-h6 elements are styled (as appropriate).
- blockquote, cite styled (as appropriate).
  Block quotes should be indented or otherwise distinct from paragraph text.
  If the Theme uses a background image or quote symbol, make sure displays correctly on both short and long quotes.

- span with style and ASCII characters should display properly.
- table, tr, th, td are styled (as appropriate).
- dl (dt, dd), ul, ol, li styled (as appropriate).
  Nested lists should be indented correctly.

- The following HTML tags should be styled appropriately to ensure semantic meaning of each  tag is preserved: address, a, big, cite, code, del, em, ins, kbd, pre, q, s, strong, sub, sup, tt, var.

Note: abbr and acronym require no special styling. Also, s may be address but was deprected with HTML 4 and can be left with no special styling as well.
div, span maintain proper block or inline display, and styled (as appropriate).


- Menus
Test with a large number of categories or pages in the menu, and test with multiple levels deep in the menus.
If custom menus are enabled, test the layout both with custom menus enabled and with the fallback navigation menus (no custom menu enabled).
- Widgets
All widgets display correctly.
The default WordPress widgets should work correctly in all widgetized areas.
If the Theme uses custom widgets, they should work correctly. (Custom widgets are programmatically added by the Theme to the list of available widgets in Appearance > Widgets.)
- Test all available widgets in all available widgetized areas in the Theme layout.
Content that appears in widgetized areas by default (hard-coded into the sidebar, for example) should disappear when widgets are enabled from Appearance > Widgets.
